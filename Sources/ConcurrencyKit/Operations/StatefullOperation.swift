/// Operation that has more 'Swifty' state management system, where state is an enum type with a number of possible cases:
/// - `ready` - an operation is initialized and is ready to be executed
/// - `executing` - an operation is performing a work
/// - `cancelled` - an operation has not yet successfully finished the work, but was interrupted
/// - `finished` - an operation has successfully finished the work
///
/// In order to use the class, you need to subclass it and override the `executableSection` method, where the work need to be done. When the work is done, you need to call the `finish` or `finishIfNotCancelled` methods in order to properly change the internal state of an operation.
